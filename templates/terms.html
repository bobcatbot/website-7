            <div style="margin-top: 4px;">We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.</div>
            <div style="margin-top: 4px;">
                <b>Personal Information Provided by You.</b> The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:

            <div style="margin-top: 4px;">We <b>do not</b> process any sensitive information. Unless the data will be harming us or the user</div>
            <div style="margin-top: 4px;">All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</div>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 15px; font-weight: 700;">How long do we keep your information?</h4>
            <div style="margin-top: 4px;"><b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</div>
            <div style="margin-top: 4px;">We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 1 year.</div>
            <div style="margin-top: 4px;">When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</div>

            <div style="margin-top: 4px;">We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.
